# The nuts and bolts of writing 2

### Sentences

-   A sentence can only do one thing
-   Identify main subject and verb
-   Place them at the beginning and keep them together (don't bury the verb)
-   Get rid of suordinate clauses (phrases that can't stand alone) from the start of sentences
-   Don't write long sentences, but do have variety in sentence length
-   Dangling Pronouns dont have a referent in their sentence. This makes it very hard to understand

### Paragraphs

-   All related to a single topic
-   Begin with a topic sentence, which summarises the point of the Paragraphs
    -   Suppors the main point of the whole document
    -   Unifies the content of the paragraph and directs the order of the sentences
    -   Usually the first sentence
-   Establish your central topic, preferablly as the subject
-   Move from Old to New Information
-   Clearly emphasise
-   Allows skim reading, but still gets the important points across
-   Make the connections between ideas explicit

### Active vs Passive Voice

Passive : Object, verb, subject (the ball was thrown by her)
Active : Subject, verb, object  (She throws the ball)

Mistakes were made, It has been shown (passive)

Look for a form of the verb to be (is, are, was, )

When to use passive:

-   When you wish to downplay action
-   When you wish to downplay the actor
-   When the actor is unknown

Many journals now request "I" or "We"

Easier to read, false perception of objectivity without first person
Problem with third person: sounds like someone else did the work
Doens't mean we start every sentence with "I" or "We"

Avoid nominalisations
Don't kill verbs by turning them into nouns
