# Nuts and Bolts of Writing 4

## Conference Abstract Assessment Task

-   The first thing a reader will see
-   A concise summary (not an excerpt)
-   What keywords would you use to find your own research
-   Explain what your reserach is about and why its important
-   Must make people want to keep reading
-   Check if references allowed in abstract

-   What did you do?
-   Why did you do it?
-   What did you find out?
-   Your main message must be clear
-   Follow instructions for journal/Conference
-   Must be beautifully crafted (lots of editing)

### Recipe for abstract Writing

-   One sentence introducing the problem
-   One sentence naming method
-   One sentence stating the main result
-   One sentence giving more detailed explanation of the result
-   One Sentence discussing the result under consideration of previous ideas
-   One sentence putting the implications of your research in a larger context

### Task

-   300 Word abstract
-   Write for an inter-disciplinary conference field (audience includes people outside field)
-   Enticing people to come to your talk
-   Include a Title (Not included in Title)
    -   Lay Summary versus Abstract Title (try something different?)
-   Read lots of example abstracts
-   Be prepared to edit extensively
-   Get rid of Jargon
-   Seek Feedback
-   250 - 300 Words
-   

## Writing your thesis (\*Q&A Session Week 7)

-   No uniform format
-   Must ask supervisor
-   Look at recent top Theses in your school
-   

## IMRD

Start broad with context, narrow to results, then broaden to implications

Introduction - Present tense
Methods - Past tense (usually written in Passive voice, but can be avoided)
Discussion - Present to interpret and explain results, past for relating to results

## Thesis vs Journal Manuscript

Journal Article explores 'one' question

#### Aim

-   Thesis: Demonstrates your experitse as a scholar; broad coverage of literature
-   Article: share a particular finding
-   

#### Audience

-   Thesis: Captive
-   Article: Wild

#### 

## Lit Reviews

-   Synthesis rather than summarise
-   Job is to interpret
-   Quality lies exclisively in excellence of ideas, reasoning and conclusions
-   Not the number of references
-   You must limit your coverage

Summarise by themes not by paper
