# Nuts and Bolts of Science Writing 3

### Remember your goal

To get your point across effectively
NOT to sound intelligent

## Punctiation

-   Aids with interpretation, like pauses and gestures in speaking
-   May indicate pause, place emphasis, alter the function or show relationships between elements of the text
-   Misplaces or missing punctuation: can create

### Apostrophes

-   Noun's possession to singular Noun
-   Nouns' possession to plural Noun

### Commas

Insert a comma wherever there would be a slight pause between words or phrases in the spoken sentence

### Semi Colons

Functions as an equal sign

Indicated two parts being joined are relatively equal in their importance

Show inter-dependency: The sentence

### Colons

No captial within sentence

### Hyphens

Rule of Thumb - Resulting word must act as one unit
Mentally exculde one of the words in question - does it still make sense?

## Writitng Titles and Captions

-   To attract
-   Catchy titles can go against the academic grain - be careful but brave
-   A good title can be the difference between someone reading your work or NOT
-   Standard compromise, use a Colon (Catchy: Descriptive)
-   

#### Possible titles

-   The search for Large Scale Structure and Missing Baryons using the Cosmic Microwave Background
-   Cosmic Microwave Background cosmology at low redshifts
-   Shedding old light on lost matter: Using the CMB to search for missing Baryons
-   First light: The search for lost matter using the Cosmic Microwave Background

### Captions

-   Good ones are usually long
-   Must be able to stand alone from text
-   Useful to give lots of information (but don't duplicate description in body of text)
-   Some readers will not read anything else!
-   Every figure and table must be reffered to in the text, but describe results
-   

## Commonly Misused Terms
