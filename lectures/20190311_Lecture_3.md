# Speaking about science: crafting a brilliant talk 1

Wednesday 2-4
Drummond Room North, Biosciences 4

#### Concerns about Public Speaking

Biggest Concern is Question Time

#### Resepct your Audience!

Many more people will hear your talk than will read your thesis (or papers)

Commit to be the best speaker you can be

### Planning

How long do you have to speak?

Never run the risk of going overtime

#### Audience

-   Who am I speaking to? Specialists or Generalists?
-   How much context do I need to provide? (Too much can be condescending)
-   What do they need?
-   How do they feel?
-   How can you best serve them?

Capture, focus and maintin audience's attention

#### Message

-   Why am I giving this talk?
-   What am I trying to acheive?
-   What do I want the audience to learn?
-   What do I want audience to think/feel?
-   What is my main message?

### Design

#### Strucutre

Opening Hook: Opening of the speech is like the bait, trying to reel the fish in

-   Annecdote
-   Image
-   Ask the Audience Questions
-   Put it in context
-   Joke (maybe)

Content depends on Audience

What can you leave out?

Must leave time for questions?

Less detail - More clarity (not dumbing down)

Be convincing - need evidence for conclusions

Storyboard (on Screen, or sticky notes)

#### Visuals

### Delivery

#### Presentation Skills

#### Be Confident and Passionate
