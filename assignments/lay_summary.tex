\maketitle

Astrophysicsts know very precisely the composition and structure of the universe from a number of independent sources. However, when we check, we do not find the amount of matter in the universe that we expect to, since it is spread out over such a large area. One method of searching for this missing matter is through trace signals in the afterglow of the Big Bang, known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). By utilising known positions of galaxies, we can look in their neighborhoods, and use the CMB to find where this missing matter might be.
